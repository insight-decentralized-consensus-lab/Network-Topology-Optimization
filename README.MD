## Abstract: 
__Observation phase__: Create omniscient archival nodes that connect to O(100) peers, and spin up enough to maintain one connection to every single organic node. Each time a peer announces a new block or timestamp, record [broadcast_ID, peer, receipt timestamp]. Recording node-by-node propagation provides will provide a comprehensive mapping of network topology/latency/connectivity. 

__Infrastructure augmentation phase__: spin up servers at disjoint (with respect to latency) positions in the network, and establish links between them to pass blocks/transactions. Since the organic nodes propagate messages on O(seconds) and intercontinental data links are O(milliseconds), the implementation of global shortcut/portal relay nodes should noticeably reduce network latency for all participants.

## Project Motivation: 
The observation node will compile a comprehensive network view, with granularity that has thus far never been attempted in the public sphere. The ability to reap benefits of centralization (fast node backbone) without *any* decentralization concessions is a significant development that should set the stage/precedent many more infrastructure augmentation projects

## Fellow Motivation: 
This project will showcase a nuanced understanding of decentralized networks, and the ability to actively tackle and modify communication-layer protocol. The infrastructure improvement phase will show that a single Fellow can reduce global latency on public infrastructure, which signals scaling savvy.
